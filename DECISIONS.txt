This document outlines the choices we have made and the reasons for making them.

We have a single remote repository, owned by Skye.
We decided that each person has their own branch (named after themselves) and pushes their changes to main. This is to avoid confusion from all working on main.
We decided that one other person must approve all pull requests to main, however it can be anyone. This is avoid approval bottlenecks.
We are reviewing each pull request with at least one other person. This is to maintain code quality.
We have each decided a topic to focus on and will create one page on this topic. This is to prevent work duplication.
We are tracking tasks with a Trello board (https://trello.com/b/t9n2t3gM/progblack-poscontributions). This is because we have used this before.
We are using a continuous delivery/deployment method, by pushing changes to main from other branches. This ensures we always have a demo available.
We are using the Bootstrap framework. This is commonly used and respected.
We are hosting with GitPages. This is an easy and recommended option.
