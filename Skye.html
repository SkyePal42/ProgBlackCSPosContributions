									The bombe was an electro-mechanical device used by British cryptologists to help
									decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War II. The
									US Navy and US Army later produced their own machines to the same functional
									specification, albeit engineered differently both from each other and from Polish
									and British bombes. <br /><br />
									The British bombe was developed from a device known as the "bomba" (Polish: bomba
									kryptologiczna), which had been designed in Poland at the Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher
									Bureau) by cryptologist Marian Rejewski, who had been breaking German Enigma
									messages for the previous seven years, using it and earlier machines. The initial
									design of the British bombe was produced in 1939 at the UK Government Code and
									Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing, with an important
									refinement devised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman. The engineering design and
									construction was the work of Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine
									Company. The first bombe, code-named Victory, was installed in March 1940 while
									the second version, Agnus Dei or Agnes, incorporating Welchman's new design, was
									working by August 1940.
									<br /><br />
									The bombe was designed to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma
									machines on the various German military networks: specifically, the set of rotors
									in use and their positions in the machine; the rotor core start positions for the
									message—the message key—and one of the wirings of the plugboard.

								<h1>Enigma</h1>
								The Enigma machine, which combined electrical and mechanical components, was
								descended from a number of designs that were submitted for patent as early as 1918
								in Germany and were produced commercially beginning in the early 1920s. Looking
								rather like a typewriter, it was battery-powered and highly portable. In addition to
								a keyboard, the device had a lamp board consisting of 26 stenciled letters, each
								with a small lightbulb behind it.
								<br /><br />
								As a cipher clerk typed a message on the keyboard in plain German, letters were
								illuminated one by one on the lamp board. An assistant recorded the letters by hand
								to form the enciphered message, which was then transmitted in Morse Code. Each bulb
								in the lamp board was electrically connected to a letter on the keyboard, but the
								wiring passed via a number of rotating wheels, with the result that the connections
								were always changing as the wheels moved. Thus, typing the same letter at the
								keyboard, such as AAAA..., would produce a stream of changing letters at the lamp
								board, such as WMEV…. It was this ever-changing pattern of connections that made
								Enigma extremely hard to break.
								<br /><br />
								The earliest success against the German military Enigma was by the Polish Cipher
								Bureau. In the winter of 1932–33, Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski deduced the
								pattern of wiring inside the three rotating wheels of the Enigma machine. (Rejewski
								was helped by photographs, received from the French secret service, showing pages of
								an Enigma operating manual for September and October 1932.) Before an Enigma
								operator began enciphering a message, he set Enigma’s three wheels (four in models
								used by the German navy) to various starting positions that were also known to the
								intended recipient. In a major breakthrough, Rejewski invented a method for finding
								out, from each intercepted German transmission, the positions in which the wheels
								had started at the beginning of the message. In consequence, Poland was able to read
								encrypted German messages from 1933 to 1939. In the summer of 1939 Poland turned
								over everything—including information about Rejewski’s Bomba, a machine he devised
								in 1938 for breaking Enigma messages—to Britain and France. In May 1940, however, a
								radical change to the Enigma system eliminated the loophole that Rejewski had
								exploited to discover the starting positions of the wheels. New methods developed at
								Bletchley Park during 1940 enabled code breakers there to continue to decipher
								German air force and army communications. However, German naval messages—including
								the all-important traffic to and from U-boats in the North Atlantic—remained
								cloaked. (The Poles too had had little success against naval Enigma.) U-boats were
								sinking such a large number of merchant ships taking food, munitions, and oil to
								Britain from North America that by 1941 some analysts were predicting that the
								sinkings would tip Britain into starvation within a few months.
								<br /><br />
								In June 1941 British mathematician Alan M. Turing and his group at Bletchley finally
								succeeded in breaking into the daily communications of the U-boats. Decoded messages
								revealed the positions of the submarines, enabling ships to avoid contact. Great
								care was always exercised to conceal the fact that Bletchley had deciphered these
								messages. For instance, British intelligence leaked false information hinting at
								revolutionary new developments in long-range radar.
								<br /><br />
								Turing was responsible for another major development in breaking Enigma. In March
								1940, Turing’s first Bombe, a code-breaking machine, was installed at Bletchley
								Park; improvements suggested by British mathematician Gordon Welchman were
								incorporated by August. This complex machine consisted of approximately 100 rotating
								drums, 10 miles of wire, and about 1 million soldered connections. The Bombe
								searched through different possible positions of Enigma’s internal wheels, looking
								for a pattern of keyboard-to-lamp board connections that would turn coded letters
								into plain German. The method depended on human instinct, though; to initiate the
								process, a code breaker had to guess a few words in the message (these guessed words
								were called a crib). The Polish Bomba, a simpler 18-drum machine, was a forerunner
								of the Bombe, but it was based on Rejewski’s method for finding the wheel positions
								at the start of the message. Unlike Rejewski’s method, the more powerful crib-based
								method invented by Turing survived the May 1940 change. The war on Enigma was
								transformed by the high-speed Bombes.

								<h1>Alan Turing</h1>
								Alan Turing is one of the most well-known Codebreakers to have worked at Bletchley
								Park, partly due to the Oscar nominated film, The Imitation Game. For the early part
								of World War Two, he was head of Hut 8, working on decrypting the German naval
								Enigma. During this time he designed the famous Bombe machine which would help speed
								up the process of decrypting Enigma and arguably paved the way for the first
								computer to be built by other Codebreakers at Bletchley Park.
								<br /><br />
								Many historians believe that Allied victory was inevitable; it was just a matter of
								how long it would take. Turing contributed significantly to the work being done at
								Bletchley Park and his Bombe machines did undoubtedly speed up the breaking of
								certain types of enemy ciphers. His work specifically on decrypting German Naval
								Enigma contributed to the Allies’ success in the Battle of the Atlantic, allowing
								vital supplies to arrive in Britain from North America in time for D-Day in 1944.
								It’s important to note that the same is true of a great many people who worked at
								Bletchley Park during World War II: brilliant minds and hard work came together to
								solve a seemingly insurmountable problem.
								<br /><br />
								Much of Turing’s work has had a massive influence on technology which has become a
								pivotal part of the modern society. During the war, he made a lot of contributions
								towards cryptanalysis with new methods to approach codebreaking such as ‘Turingery’.
								This is still relevant today because cryptography underpins internet security and
								data protection. Turing is also considered one of the fathers of computer science:
								Before the war he was working on an idea which he called a ‘universal machine’ which
								is similar to a computer. His Bombe machine also proved that machines could be used
								to make problem solving easier and quicker. His work on artificial intelligence has
								also influenced research into this field and his proposed assessment for computer
								intelligence is now referred to as “the Turing test”.
								<br /><br />
								It seems that Turing was not bashful about his homosexuality, nor that he seemed to
								struggle with being gay, but neither did he make a point of telling people, as
								homosexuality was a criminal offence. In 1941, he proposed to his colleague and
								fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst Joan Clarke, but broke off the engagement
								shortly afterwards, telling her that he was homosexual. She was apparently unfazed
								by the revelation. It appears that Turing was generally understood to be homosexual,
								but it was not publicly spoken about. In January 1952, Turing started a relationship
								with Arnold Murray and on 23rd January Turing’s house was burgled. Murray told
								Turing that he knew the burglar. Turing reported this to the police, and in the
								course of the investigation admitted that he and Murray were in a relationship. Both
								men were charged with ‘gross indecency’. Turing pled ‘guilty’ in the trial on 31st
								March 1952 and was given a choice of imprisonment or probation (the latter included
								a course of hormonal treatment). Today, Turing is often used as a figurehead for the
								rights of gay people. He’s a relatively well-known person and is used to highlight
								the mistreatment of homosexual men in the past.

								<h1>The Bombe's Legacy</h1>
								The Bombes represented the first mass production of a specially designed
								cryptanalytical machine. They heralded the industrialisation of codebreaking and the
								intelligence they provided was crucial to Allied success in WW2. They were a
								significant part of the Bletchley Park operation, which was so successful that the
								Germans remained unaware the information sent on their “unbreakable” Engima machines
								had actually been cracked by the Allies.
								<br />

								<br /><br />
								Turing stands alongside Churchill, Eisenhower, and a short glory-list of other
								wartime principals as a leading figure in the Allied victory over Hitler. There
								should be a statue of him in London among Britain's other leading war heroes. Some
								historians estimate that Bletchley Park's massive codebreaking operation, especially
								the breaking of U-boat Enigma, shortened the war in Europe by as many as two to four
								years. If Turing and his group had not weakened the U-boats' hold on the North
								Atlantic, the 1944 Allied invasion of Europe - the D-Day landings - could have been
								delayed, perhaps by about a year or even longer, since the North Atlantic was the
								route that ammunition, fuel, food and troops had to travel in order to reach Britain
								from America. Harry Hinsley, a member of the small, tight-knit team that battled
								against Naval Enigma, and who later became the official historian of British
								intelligence, underlined the significance of the U-boat defeat. Any delay in the
								timing of the invasion, even a delay of less than a year, would have put Hitler in a
								stronger position to withstand the Allied assault, Hinsley points out. The
								fortification of the French coastline would have been even more formidable, huge
								Panzer Armies would have been moved into place ready to push the invaders back into
								the sea - or, if that failed, then to prevent them from crossing the Rhine into
								Germany - and large numbers of rocket-propelled V2 missiles would have been raining
								down on southern England, wreaking havoc at the ports and airfields tasked to
								support the invading troops.
								<br /><br />
								In the actual course of events, it took the Allied armies a year to fight their way
								from the French coast to Berlin; but in a scenario in which the invasion was
								delayed, giving Hitler more time to prepare his defences, the struggle to reach
								Berlin might have taken twice as long. At a conservative estimate, each year of the
								fighting in Europe brought on average about seven million deaths, so the
								significance of Turing's contribution can be roughly quantified in terms of the
								number of additional lives that might have been lost if he had not achieved what he
								did. If U-boat Enigma had not been broken, and the war had continued for another two
								to three years, a further 14 to 21 million people might have been killed. Of course,
								even in a counterfactual scenario in which Turing was not able to break U-boat
								Enigma, the war might still have ended in 1945 because of some other occurrence,
								also contrary-to-fact, such as the dropping of a nuclear weapon on Berlin.
								Nevertheless, these colossal numbers of lives do convey a sense of the magnitude of
								Turing's contribution.
