				<h1>Impact of Computer Science on the Health Industry</h1>

				<p></p>
				<!--Paragraph giving context overview-->
				<p>
					Computer Science has had an impact on almost all aspects of the health industry - from
					diagnostics, research and treatment to operational management. The use of technology in
					health care continues to grow and innovations continue to be made.
				</p>

				<h2>Bioinformatics</h2>

				<p>
					Bioinformatics, which uses computational processes to examine large amounts of biological
					data, has brought a huge amount of progress to healthcare. Bioinformatics reduces both the
					financial cost of research and the time taken. For example, bioinformatics made
					forecasting particular molecules which may inhibit COVID-19 possible, so that laboraties
					knew which to target in their testing. Bioinformatics can narrow down large data sets in
					to smaller plausible sets and thereby give direction to research.
				</p>

				<p>
					Bioinformatics can also make a difference on a level closer to individual communities -
					rudimentary bioinformatics tools are already being used in treating patients.
