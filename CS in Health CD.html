                <h1>Impact of Computer Science on the Health Industry</h1>

                <p> </p>
                <!--Paragraph giving context overview-->
                <p>Computer Science has had an impact on almost all aspects of the health industry - from diagnostics, research and treatment to operational management. The use of technology in health care continues to grow and innovations continue to be made.</p>
                
                <h2> Bioinformatics</h2>

                <p>Bioinformatics, which is a section of biotechnology that uses computational processes to examine large amounts of biological data, has brought a huge amount of progress to healthcare. Bioinformatics reduces both the financial cost of research and the time taken. For example, bioinformatics made forecasting particular molecules which may inhibit COVID-19 possible, so that laboraties knew which to target in their testing. Bioinformatics can narrow down large data sets in to smaller plausible sets and thereby give direction to research.  </p>

                <p>Bioinformatics can also make a difference on a level closer to individual communities - rudimentary bioinformatics tools are already being used in treating patients. The search tool <a href="https://www.omim.org"> OMIM</a> (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) is currently used in hospitals for information around genetic disorders, and there are other examples. </p>

                <p>In the future, bioinformatics is predicted to give rise to a new wave of personalied medical treatment and drugs. Bioinformatics made the mapping of the human genome possible, as accomplished in 2003. The project greatly advanced the methods used for DNA sequencing. This information may lead to personalised treatment based on the genetics of the patient, if the financial and time costs allow.</p>

                <p>If you are interested in learning more, the statistical language R is one of the most used languages involved. Other languages such as Java, C and C++ (complied languages) and Python and Perl (scrpting languages) are also useful for bioinformatics. </p>

                <h2>Medical Software</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Electronic Health Record Software</dt>
                    <dd>EHR software is some of the most used software in hospitals. EHR software stores data on patients - such as past and planned procedures, personal details, appointments and medication - in an efficient and accessible way.</dd>
                    <dt>Medical Research Software</dt>
                    <dd>Medical research software is often open source - allowing the medical community at large to contribute to and access their shared knowledge. This software makes research more efficient, but can also help in the education and training of future medical professionals. The Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (<a href="https://biospecimens.cancer.gov/relatedinitiatives/overview/caBig.asp">caBIG</a>) is one such open source network for sharing research, data and tools that may help prevent cancer, understand the causes or treat the symptoms.</dd>
