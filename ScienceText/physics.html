<p style="color: red">
    As mentioned on the first page with references to the LHC and Curiosity rover, computers are often required to facililitate Physics
    experiments. With developments towards ever-smaller phenomena, computational detectors are needed to understand the minute
    differences which are the objects of study. However, this can also manifest on the macro scale, such as using computers to make
    tiny adjustments to the orientation of telescopes.

    Furthermore, the acceptance of quantum mechanical theories introduce massive complexity and massive uncertainty, due to the nature
    of the theory being inherently probabilistic. Computer modeling and approximations allow us to gather solutions to otherwise
    intractable problems.
