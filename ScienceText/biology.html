<h2 style="color: lightgreen">Biology - The Human Genome Project</h2>
<p style="color: lightgreen">
    The Human Genome Project was a mammoth effort, producing a genome sequence allowed us to comprehend the complete genetic blueprint 
    for a human. The main project ran from 1984 until 2003 and accounted for over 90% of the human genome, however developments were
    still being achieved in May 2021 (99.7% complete).<sup>[4]</sup>and March 2022 (100% complete).<sup>[5]</sup>

    Due to the relatively slow speed of humans, computer programs were used meet the genome sequencing demands. A technology called
    RNA-seq allows scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells replacing old annotations with more accurate, direct
    measurements. Such technology co-evolved with the HGP, both enabling the project and being developed in turn.

    The HGP also raises some interesting ethical issues. Despite the initial collection of data being anonymised and spread between
    several donors, there are concerns that similar efforts in future could be used to discriminate against people in damaging ways,
    such as only hiring those who are provably fit and healthy.
