<h2 style="color: lightgreen">Biology - The Human Genome Project</h2>
<p style="color: lightgreen">
    The Human Genome Project was a mammoth effort, producing a genome sequence allowed us to comprehend the complete genetic blueprint 
    for a human. The main project ran from 1984 until 2003 and accounted for over 90% of the human genome, however developments were
    still being achieved in May 2021 (99.7% complete).[4][5]and January 2022 (100% complete).

    The HGP also raises some interesting ethical issues. Despite the initial collection of data being anonymised and spread between
    several donors, there are concerns that similar efforts in future could be used to discriminate against people in damaging ways,
    such as only hiring those who are provably fit and healthy.
