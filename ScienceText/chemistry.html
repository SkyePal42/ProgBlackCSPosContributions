<p style="color: yellow">
    Multiple simulation and modeling products already exists, such as Aspen Plus, Chemcad, DynoChem and HSC Chemistry, which vary in
    types and application of the simulations.<sup>[this]</sup>

    Replacing experiments with simulations can save time and money, allowing more tests, and for more chances to make new and interesting
    discoveries. Improved molecular simulations have benefits across many applications of chemistry. It could develop chemical materials
    design process, improve biological drugs and medicines more quickly, and lead to improvements in catalysts – such as for the 
    Haber-Bosch process which consumes ~2% of annual global energy use.<sup>[42]</sup>

    However, computational chemistry simulations have significant limitations, namely in the hardware that is very resource intensive.
    For example, simulating a 70-atom molecule would take over 13 billion years – longer than the current lifetime of the universe.<sup>
    [35]</sup> For this reason, significant developments in computation are still needed, to realise the most important results.
